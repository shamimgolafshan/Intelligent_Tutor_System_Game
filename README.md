# Intelligent Tutor System (ITS) Game

This repository contains a Unity-based game designed as an Intelligent Tutor System (ITS) to assist children in learning vocabulary. The application features three main components: one for children to play the game, one for parents to enter their children's answers during daily conversations, and one for speech therapists to input the child's responses. The application aggregates these inputs and provides a chart displaying the child's progress in vocabulary learning.
